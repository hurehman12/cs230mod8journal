Q1
The Gaming Room is a client that partnered with Creative Technology Solutions to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based platform that could run on multiple operating systems.
They wanted a scalable, secure design that allowed players from different devices to connect and play together. The software needed to ensure unique player and team names, maintain a single active game instance, and protect user data across all platforms.

Q2
I did particularly well at explaining technical concepts in a way that was easy to understand. My recommendations were clear and practical, and I organized the document in a way that made it professional and easy to follow. I also focused on aligning my suggestions with the client’s needs rather than using overly technical language.

Q3
Working through the design document helped me think more deeply about how the system should function before writing any code. 
It forced me to consider structure, scalability, and data flow early in the process. This made the development process smoother because I already had a strong understanding of how each part of the system would connect and operate.

Q4
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the System Architecture View by adding a visual diagram that shows how the client, server, and database interact. A diagram would make the system easier to understand and provide a quick reference for developers or stakeholders who are new to the project.

Q5
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on accessibility, performance, and security. The Gaming Room wanted a game that anyone could play on any device, so I designed a web-based solution that worked through browsers and used secure connections to protect data. 
Considering user needs is important because it ensures the final product is easy to use, reliable, and enjoyable, which helps build trust and satisfaction among players.

Q6
I approached designing the software using an object-oriented and layered structure, separating the interface, logic, and data layers. I used analysis and planning to decide what tools and designs would best meet the client’s goals. In the future, I would use the same structured approach while adding early user feedback and prototypes to confirm that the design meets real user expectations before coding begins.
